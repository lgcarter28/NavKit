# NavKit Master Roadmap

This document is the canonical current-state handoff and working roadmap. It is reconciled against the repository as it exists today, not merely against older planning notes.

The important status change: NavKit now has a working desktop simulation path for a GPS/GNSS-aided ECEF INS. The remaining roadmap is therefore organized around hardening, validation, scenario breadth, embedded readiness, and future product expansion rather than "first make the INS exist."

Detailed historical phase notes are preserved under `docs/roadmap_details/`. This file is intentionally short; use the detail files only when you need design memory or expanded completed-phase context.

## How to use this roadmap

- Treat checked items as verified current behavior or completed owner/project milestones.
- Treat unchecked items as future work, grouped by the boundary they affect.
- Before starting an unchecked pass, turn it into a small implementation plan with named files, tests, and acceptance evidence.
- Keep normal startup clean: runtime PVA initialization, filter covariance initialization, truth/error simulation, transfer alignment, and advanced analysis/restart features are distinct concepts.
- Keep embedded-facing product-core code free of simulator truth/error context.
- Preserve the working ECEF INS/GNSS scenarios while refactoring.

- [x] Runtime JSON configs are decomposed into explicit role-keyed components for trajectory, IMU, GNSS, PVA initialization, filter initialization, and propagation overrides, while run-level logging stays inline in each scenario.
- [x] Runtime initialization is split into `pva_initialization` and `filter_initialization`.
- [x] PVA initialization supports random error, explicit error, no-error, and direct-value component examples.
- [x] Filter initial covariance supports compile-time defaults and runtime overrides with diagonal, full, and PVA-plus-remaining-error-state forms.

- [x] Offline analysis produces ECEF/NED error/covariance plots, dashboard plots, filter-correction plots, GNSS debug plots, IMU increment/debug/error plots, innovation plots, NIS/p-value plots, and histograms.
- [x] `tools/run_scenario.py` provides a one-liner sim-plus-plot workflow.
- [x] `tools/run_monte_carlo.py` provides a seeded campaign workflow with replayable generated run configs and first-pass aggregate covariance plots.

- [x] LaTeX algorithm references exist for ECEF navigator v1 and IMU emulator v1.
- [x] Setup, configuration, architecture, naming, founding, license, changelog, copyright, profiling, and roadmap documentation exists.
- [x] Compile-time and runtime tests cover the current policy, config, simulation, logging, and initialization seams.

## Current phase

NavKit is currently in Phase 6: Monte Carlo and batch analysis. Phase 5 produced the first working ECEF INS/GNSS baseline; Phase 6 turns that single-run product into repeatable statistical evidence.

## Active passes

## Pass 6.8: Monte Carlo initialization support

- [ ] Connect Monte Carlo execution to the Phase 5 advanced analysis/restart initialization path for deterministic seeded initial estimate errors and mid-trajectory restart studies.
- [ ] Support deterministic seeded draws for initial estimate errors and simulator error terms without leaking simulator truth/error context into product-core code.
- [ ] Add a separate simulation/analysis-only Monte Carlo initial-estimate-error path. This path should support deterministic seeds, explicit error vectors, and covariance-colored random draws in the selected `StateDef::Error` ordering so analysis runs can start mid-trajectory with statistically controlled estimator errors.
- [ ] For Monte Carlo estimate-error initialization, distinguish between directly setting nominal estimates and sampling estimate errors relative to truth. For persistent estimated states such as IMU biases, the statistically consistent form is `estimated_state = true_state + sampled_estimate_error`, so the actual initial estimate error falls within the configured covariance.
- [ ] Introduce an explicit app/sim-side reference context before implementing truth-relative non-PVA initialization. A future `InitialEstimateReference`-style object should carry truth kinematics plus truth sensor error/calibration states, such as IMU turn-on/in-run bias, without letting app-support initialization reach into simulator internals ad hoc.
